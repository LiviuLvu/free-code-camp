# Simon Game  

### Game features  

* Command pannel for start game, strict mode and restart

### Gameplay 
You are presented with a random series of button presses.  
Each time you input a series of button presses correctly, you see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.  
You can play in strict mode where if you get a button press wrong, it notifies that you have done so, and the game restarts from step one.  
You can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct.
