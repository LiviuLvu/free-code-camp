Written in javasctipt with jquery  
Used scss with gulp just for fun. The code is very small and these tools are not needed.  
Attempted to use only simple functions that do one thing.  
  
### Game functionality:  
• You can choose player on gane start  
• On game over, win spots are highlighted.  
• On game over a nessage announces the winner, or tie, and a reset button appears.  
• On reset the choose player menu is available again.  
  
  
To do:  
Make the Ai impossible to beat, using minmax algorithm.
